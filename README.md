# Project Ideas - Open Source :wave:

This is a simple project you can contribute to! This will help with finding project ideas, learning pull requests, and getting a feel for the open source community.

## Getting started

There are a few ways to use this project.

1. Find projects to work on!
1. Contribute to the project by creating a pull request.

### Find Projects to work on!

You can visit the [project ideas](https://callanbr.github.io/project-ideas/) page to find projects to work on. Feel free to use the `random` button to find a random project or list all projects.

### Contribute to the project by creating a pull request.

Fork the repository and add a project or improve the website and create a pull request. You can learn more about pull requests here:

- [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
- [Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

**IDEA!** Creating a written tutorial on how to create your first pull request would be a great way to contribute to this project!

- You can simply add a project idea to the projects.json file or help improve the website for a better user experience! :sunglasses:
